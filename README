A repository to manage my "Proseminar" about the Markov decision processes (MDP) and the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).

A Proseminar consists of a small dissertation and a presentation.

This Proseminar was organized by the ISAS (http://isas.uka.de/en/Main_Page) at the KIT (www.kit.edu).
